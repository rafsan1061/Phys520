I like that github or git give an opportunity to work with others simultaneously and collaboratively and I can see changes and resolve issues efficiently

I dislike that I cannot still figure out how to use git efficiently and this is too overwhelming for me as a beginner

How can I resolve merge conflicts efficiently?
